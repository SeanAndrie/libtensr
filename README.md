# libtensr

`libtensr` is a lightweight multi-dimensional tensor library written in C, designed for numerical and linear algebra operations. It provides a simple API for creating, managing, and accessing N-dimensional arrays (tensors) with stride-based memory layout — similar in concept to NumPy arrays, but implemented in pure C.

The library depends on the <a href='https://github.com/SeanAndrie/libft-adapt'>libft-adapt</a>
 repository, which provides foundational utilities and data structures, and should be placed in the root directory alongside it to ensure proper compilation and linkage.
