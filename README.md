# libtensr

`libtensr` is a lightweight multi-dimensional tensor library written in C, designed for numerical and linear algebra operations in small-scale projects such as MiniRT.
It provides a simple API for creating, managing, and accessing N-dimensional arrays (tensors) with stride-based memory layout — similar in concept to NumPy arrays, but implemented in pure C.
